####### SDR RECEIVER CONFIGURATION #######
# SDR Receiver type to be used for satellite reception.
# Available support is for RTL-SDR and  AIRSPY R2 and Mini
# Default is to use an RTL-SDR device with librtlsdr.
RTL-SDR
#AIRSPY
#
# Device Index. Default is 0 (use first SDR device).
# Maximum value is 8 for data sanity checking.
0
#
# SDR Receiver's I/Q Sample Rate S/s.
# THIS DEPENDS ON THE SDR RX IN USE.
# For RTL-SDR,      288000 S/s.
# For Airspy R2,    2500000 S/s.
# For Airspy Mini,  3000000 S/s.
288000
#2500000
#3000000
#
# Low Pass Roofing Filter Bandwidth. This should be more than
# 100000 Hz for sanity checking. Default is 110000 Hz
# and this is probably the narrowest useable bandwidth.
110000
#
# Manual Tuner Gain setting. If 0, then Auto AGC will be used.
# Value range is 0 - 100% and default is 95% (manual AGC used).
95
#
# Synthesizer Frequency Error correction factor. This is in
# ppm (parts per million) but it has to be an integer number.
# Maximum +/- value for sanity checks is 100.
0
#
####### Mlrpt operational parameters #######
#
# Satellite Transmitter Frequency in kHz (default Meteor M2)
137100
#
# Duration in seconds of image decoding operation (900). This
# is usually to long (15 min) unless a high gain rotating
# directional antenna is used. This value can be changed here
# or using the "Operation Timer" menu item in the pop-up menu.
900
#
####### LRPT Demodulator Parameters #######
#
# RRC (Raised Root Cosine) Filter Order. Default is 32.
32
#
# RRC Filter alpha factor. Default is 0.6 and need not be changed.
0.6
#
# Initial Costas PLL Loop Bandwidth in Hz. Default is 200. May be
# experimented with to give best compromise between early PLL lock
# and stray locks.
100
#
# Costas PLL In-Lock Phase Error Threshold. Below this the PLL
# will be in Locked mode. The PLL Unlocked Threshold will be
# set at +5% above this. The actual value will depend on Receiver
# noise levels and antenna performance. It should be selected so
# that the PLL Locked indication should just be off with no signal.
0.80
#
# Modulation Mode: 1 = QPSK  2 = DOQPSK  3 = IDOQPSK
1
#
# Symbol Rate of the (O)QPSK Transmission in Sy/s. Default is 72000.
72000
#
# Demodulator Interpolation factor. Default is 4 and need not be changed.
4
#
####### LRPT Decoder Parameters #######
# Decoded Image Output Mode:
# 1 = Output a combined APID channels pseudo-colorized image.
# 2 = Output individual monochrome images of APID channels.
# 3 = Output both channel images and pseudo color combination.
3
#
# File type for saving monochrome channel (APD) images ONLY!
# 1 = Save as jpeg. 2 = Save as PGM file. 3 = Save as both.
1
#
# JPEG compression quality factor (percent). Default is 85 %
85
#
# Enable saving of Raw (unprocessed) Images as well.
# 0 = no, 1 = yes.
0
#
# Image Normalization (Stretches image contrast). 0 = no, 1 = yes.
1
#
# Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE).
# Enhances Regional Contrast of images very effectively.
# Will only have effect if the above option is also enabled.
# 0 = no, 1 = yes.
1
#
# Rectify images: Corrects geometric distortion of images caused
# by the curvature of Earth and Tangential distortion.
# 0 = no, 1 = Use the W2RG algorithm, 2 = Use the 5B4AZ algorithm.
1
#
# Pseudo-colorize images: Does some speculative colorization of the
# combined pseudo-color image. 0 = no, 1 = yes.
1
#
# Image APID's (channels) for red, green, blue used for combined
# pseudo-color image.
# Red APID (mlrpt Channel 0)
66
#
# Green APID (mlrpt Channel 1)
65
#
# Blue APID (mlrpt Channel 2)
64
#
# APIDs of images to invert their palette. This is normally useful
# for the Infrared images were cold is dark and hot is white. There
# should be three entries and 0 per place will disable this option
# for the entry.
67, 68, 69
#
# Range of pixel values to use when combining channels, to
# produce a reasonable color balance in the combined color
# image. Values must be between 0 and 255.
#
# For the Red Channel
0-230
#
# For the Green Channel
0-255
#
# For the Blue Channel
60-255
#
# When using the optional Pseudo-colorize function of mlrpt,
# the pixel values of the Blue channel image are increased
# so that they are in the range specified below. This helps
# because Histogram Equalization darkens the parts of the
# Blue Channel image that are watery areas (seas or lakes).
#
# Blue Channel minimum pixel value. Must be between 0-255.
# It is also the Blue Channel pixel value below which pixel
# values are mapped into the range between these two values.
60
#
# Blue Channel maximum pixel value when mapping pixel values
# into the range between these two values. Must be higher
# than the above minimum but less than 255.
80
#
# Blue channel cloudy area pixel value threshold. In pseudo-
# colorize mode, pixels with a value higher than this will be
# assumed to be cloudy areas and the RGB values in the combo
# color image will be made all equal to the blue channel pixels
210
#
# Directory to save received images in. Normally it would be
# /home/<user>/mlrpt/images/ if Default is entered here. Else
# the specified directory will be used. Maximum 80 characters.
Default (/home/<user>/mlrpt/images/)
#/var/lrpt/images/
